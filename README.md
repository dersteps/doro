# doro
A simple pomodoro-like timer written in Javascript with AngularJS, Node/Electron.

## Purpose
The whole point of this app right now is teaching myself how to create apps with Electron and AngularJS. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Notice
This is my way of learning something new, so please do not assume that the code in this repository is in any way perfect or something you should copy and/or use. I am just messing around with stuff in here. You have been warned ;)
